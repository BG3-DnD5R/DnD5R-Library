## Very Basic Symlink Details

- Each copy of `DnD5R_Library_7b0e8f3f-c012-e010-5167-5d0f30cf6259` should be Symlinked to your BG3 data folder.
- The default location will be `\steamapps\common\Baldurs Gate 3\Data` which shouldn't be too difficult to find.
- These are the folders:
  - `Data\Editor\Mods\`
  - `Data\Mods\`
  - `Data\Projects\`
  - `Data\Public\`
- There are many ways to Symlink. I use [Link Shell Extension](https://schinagl.priv.at/nt/hardlinkshellext/linkshellextension.html).
